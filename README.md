# Car-Sales-Analysis-in-Tableau
Our primary goal was to create a dashboard offering real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) from our sales data, empowering us to make informed decisions, track progress, and identify growth opportunities.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Overview: Tracking Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales and Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales gave us a bird's eye view of our performance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Price Analysis: Analyzing YTD Average Price and YOY Growth in Average Price provided insights into pricing strategies and customer preferences.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cars Sold Metrics: Monitoring YTD Cars Sold and YOY Growth in Cars Sold helped us understand sales volume dynamics.

üìä Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement
To visually communicate our insights effectively, we created various charts:

1Ô∏è‚É£ YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Displayed a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales, enabling us to identify seasonal patterns and fluctuations.
2Ô∏è‚É£ YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualized the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart, facilitating understanding of popular car models.
3Ô∏è‚É£ YTD Total Sales by Color: Presented the contribution of various car colors to YTD total sales through a donut chart, aiding in identifying color preferences among customers.
4Ô∏è‚É£ YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcased the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart, providing geographical insights and helping to allocate resources effectively.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provided a tabular grid displaying the sales trend for each company, facilitating easy comparison and identification of top performers.
